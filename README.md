# AIROC™ BTSTACK: Bluetooth® WakeOnLE for Linux host

This code example demonstrates the Bluetooth® Low Energy WakeOnLE functionality with the AIROC™ Wi-Fi & Bluetooth® combo chip using Embedded Linux platforms (Arm® Cortex®-A Class processors).

The application demonstrates a LE vendor-specific device. After initialization of AIROC™ BTSTACK, set a specific UUID or UUID + Manufacture Data to the controller to wake up the controller and host when the controller receives the specific advertisement with a UUID or UUID + Manufacture Data. Use GPIO DEV-WAKE for the host to control the controller to enter sleep mode and wake up, another GPIO HOST-WAKE for the controller to notify the host.

**Figure 1. Block diagram: Hardware setup**

![](images/block_diagram.png)

## Software setup

Set up a cross compiler according to the target platform along with CMake on the Linux host PC based on Ubuntu 20.04.

1. Open a terminal on the Linux host PC.

2. Use the following command to install the cross compiler, build tools, and dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git cmake gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu build-essential -y
   ```

## Using the code example

Do the following on the Linux host PC to compile the code example:

1. Create a directory under `$HOME` on the Linux host PC and switch to the created directory. For example, use the following commands to switch:
   ```bash
   mkdir $HOME/Linux_CE
   cd $HOME/Linux_CE
   ```

2. Fetch the code example source code using the following:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Infineon/linux-example-btstack-wakeonle.git
   ```

3. Clone the code example dependencies (BTSTACK library and Linux porting layer source code) using the following commands:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Infineon/btstack.git --branch release-v3.6.1
   git clone https://github.com/Infineon/bluetooth-linux.git --branch release-v2.0.0
   ```

   Three different directories are created after cloning the code example and its dependencies, as shown in **Figure 2**.

   **Figure 2. Code example directory structure**

   ![](images/directory_structure.png)

4. Use the following command to clone the Bluetooth® firmware:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Infineon/combo-bluetooth-firmware.git
   ```
   The user can choose appropriate Bluetooth® firmware for particular AIROC™ Wi-Fi & Bluetooth® combo chip from cloned "combo-bluetooth-firmware" directory.
5. Create the build folder under the code example source folder and use the following commands to build the code example:
   ```
   cd $HOME/Linux_CE/linux-example-btstack-wakeonle
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:PATH=<GCC_CROSS_COMPILER> ../ && make
   ```
   Where, `GCC_CROSS_COMPILER` is the target cross compiler for GCC (generally */usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc* for Arm&reg;64-based targets)

   The code example executable is generated under the *build* folder with the same name of code example.

   For example, in this project, the "linux-example-btstack-wakeonle" executable is generated at */home/$USER/Linux_CE/linux-example-btstack-wakeonle/build*.

## Operation

This code example acts as LE Scanner. The remote device will be Advertiser.

The following two devices are required to demonstrate this application:
   - Hardware platform (Linux host platform + AIROC™ Wi-Fi &  combo chip, i.e., the device running the WakeOnLE application)
   - A LE advertiser application on mobile or laptop.

1. Take SSH console of target platform.
   ```bash
   ssh <TARGET_DEVICE_USER_NAME>@<TARGET_DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS>
   ```

2. Copy the code example executable and AIROC™ BTSTACK library from the Linux host PC to the target platform using [SCP](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/TransferFiles). For example, use the following commands:
   ```
   cd $HOME/Linux_CE/linux-example-btstack-wakeonle/lib
   scp libwiced_exp.so <TARGET_USER>@<TARGET_IP>:<TARGET_PATH>/.
   cd $HOME/Linux_CE/linux-example-btstack-wakeonle/build
   scp linux-example-btstack-wakeonle <TARGET_USER>@<TARGET_IP>:<TARGET_PATH>/.
   cd $HOME/Linux_CE/btstack/stack/COMPONENT_WICED_DUALMODE/COMPONENT_ARMv8_LINUX/COMPONENT_GCC
   scp libbtstack.so <TARGET_USER>@<TARGET_IP>:<TARGET_PATH>/.
   scp <FW_FILE.hcd> <TARGET_USER>@<TARGET_IP>:<TARGET_PATH>/.
   ```
   Where,
   - `TARGET_USER` is the user name of the target platform.
   - `TARGET_IP` is an IP address of the target platform.
   - `TARGET_PATH` is the path of target platform.
   - *`FW_FILE.hcd`* file is the Bluetooth® Firmware file cloned in [Using the code example section](#using-the-code-example).


3. Add the udev rule in the target host board for HCI UART and GPIO to bypass root access. Use the following steps to create and set up a udev rule.

   **Note:** If you have root access, the following udev rules are not required; you can execute the code example with `sudo` permissions or by switching to the root user.

   1. Create a new *.rules* (for example, *combo-chip-uart-port.rules*) file under the */etc/udev/rules.d/* directory for HCI UART. Use the following commands:

      **IMX8Nano:**

      ```bash
      echo "KERNEL==\"ttymxc0\"d,SYMLINK+=\"combo_chip_uart\",MODE=\"0666\"" | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/combo-chip-uart-port.rules
      ```

      **RPICM4:**

      ```bash
      echo "KERNEL==\"ttyAMA0\",SYMLINK+=\"combo_chip_uart\",MODE=\"0666\"" | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/combo-chip-uart-port.rules
      ```


   2. Create new *.rules* (for example, *combo-chip-gpio-port.rules*) for BT_REG_ON GPIO under the */etc/udev/rules.d/* directory. Use the following commands:

      **IMX8Nano & RPICM4:**

      1. Create a rule file using the following command:

         ```bash
         sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/combo-chip-gpio-port.rules.rules
         ```

      2. Add the following rules in created files:

         ```bash
         SUBSYSTEM=="gpio*", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'chown -R $user:$group /sys/class/gpio/export /sys/class/gpio/unexport;'"
         SUBSYSTEM=="gpio*", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'chown -R $user:$group /sys%p/direction /sys%p/value; chmod 660 /sys%p/direction /sys%p/value;'"
         ```


   3. Reboot the target device:

      ```bash
      sudo reboot
      ```
       Where,
      - `ttymxc0` and `ttyAMA0` are HCI UART ports for IMX8Nano and RPICM4 respectively
      - `combo_chip_uart` is a friendly name for the HCI UART port
      - `0666` is the permission mask to bypass the root access for HCI UART

4. Execute the application by setting the paths of the AIROC™ BTSTACK library using the following command on the target platform:
   ```
   cd <TARGET_PATH>
   chmod +x <APP_NAME>
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<BTSTACK_LIB_PATH>
   ./<APP_NAME> -c <COM_PORT> -b <HCI_BAUDRATE> -f <FW_DL_BAUDRATE> -r <GPIOCHIPx> <REGONPIN> -n -p <FW_FILE_NAME>.hcd -d 112233221144 -w <GPIOCHIPx> <DEV-WAKE> -h <GPIOCHIPx> <HOST-WAKE>
   ```
   Where,
   - `TARGET_PATH` is the path of the target platform where the code example application copied to.

## HowTo
   1. After the CE running and download FW complete, press 1 on the keyboard and press Enter, it will show the MENU.
   2. Press 3 on the keyboard and press Enter, to enable wakeonLe by the ADV packet with 16 bit UUID.
   3. Follow the instruction, eg: enter 11 22, need have a space between 11 and 22.
   4. After press Enter, it will show POLL GPIO 12, it means Controller enter WakeonLE mode successfully.
   5. Enable advertiser in nRFConnect APP from Android Phone to advertise the ADV which have the specific UUID, eg: "11 22"
   6. When you see "HOST WAKE ASSERT" in CE program, means Controller already receive this ADV and notify host through Host-Wake.
   7. In Menu option 5: 32 bit UUID and MANUFACTURE DATA. the MANUFACTURE DATA have 2 part, the first part is COMPANY_ID. It define in include/wakeon_le.h
	```
   #define COMPANY_ID				   0x0009
	```
   0x0009 is Infineon's company ID, change it to what you need.
   8. the second part of manufacture data is the data pattern.

## Debugging

You can debug the example using the following generic Linux debugging mechanism:

- **Debugging by logging:** Add prints in the application and check them during execution.

- **Debugging using GDB:** For more details, see [GDB man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gdb).

## Design and implementation

This code example does the following:

1. Parses the command-line arguments

2. Initializes the AIROC™ BTSTACK library for the AIROC™ combo chip.

  The WakeOnLE Application uses the following to achieve the WakeOnLE function:

   - UART Sleep Mode: Uses low active for BT_HOST_WAKE (HOST-WAKE) and BT_DEV_WAKE (DEV-WAKE)

   - APCF: 16-Bit UUID, 32-Bit UUID, and 32-Bit UUID + Manufacture Data.
    Manufacture Data include 2-byte company id, in this CE is 0x0009, change this company id to what you want.

  Wake-On-LE: Device Bluetooth® controller acts as an observer. When device Bluetooth® controller receives an advertisement with specific matching conditions, it wakes up the device host via BT_HOST_WAKE (HOST-WAKE).

  **Figure 9. System block diagram**

  ![](images/system_block_diagram.png)

3. Wake-On-LE working flow:
  ```bash
  a. Clear APCF settings.
  b. Set APCF settings.
    i. Set APCF data UUID or Manufacture Data, or both.
    ii. Set APCF filter.
    iii. Enable APCF.
  c. Start LE scan.
  d. Set Sleep mode.
  e. Deassert GPIO DEV-WAKE from device host.
  f. Device host waits for GPIO HOST-WAKE assert.
  ```
  **Figure 10. Working flow**

  ![](images/working-flow.png)

4. Wake up flow

  **Figure 11. Wake up flow**

  ![](images/wakeup-flow.png)

**Note:** It should use the callback "bt_sleep_cmpl_cback" function of set sleep mode to assert DEV-WAKE.
