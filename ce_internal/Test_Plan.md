# Test Plan

|Test Case ID| Steps      | Expected result|
|------------|------------|----------------|
|1          | **Basic Test**: To be added as per CE requirement for each CEs. Add multiple Basic Tests if required. | Test should pass successfully.
|2	        | **Advanced Test** : To be added as per CE requirement for each CEs. Add multiple Advanced Tests if required. | Test should pass successfully.

> **Note:** Basic test category meant for quick sanity test of the example with any updated dependency assets. Advanced tests are to cover the complete example functionality when the implementation/design gets changed.

Test cases were executed using executable files generated using the following combination:

**CE Build**: Refers to testing by creating the project by downloading or cloning the project repo and building and programming from the host system.  See the Readme’s Using the Code Example for steps.

**TOOLCHAIN** = Toolchain used for building the application: GNU Arm® GCC aarch64 v7.5.0 (`GCC_ARM`)

**TARGET** = Supported kit target (See Readme for supported kits:)
  * AIROC™ CYW5557x Wi-Fi & Bluetooth® combo chip
